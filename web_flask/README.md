# What is a route ?
* In web development, a route refers to a URL pattern or a specific URL path within a web application. Routes determine how the application should respond when a client (typically a web browser) accesses a particular URL.

# How to handle variables in a route ?
* In Flask, you can handle variables in a route by defining dynamic parts in the URL pattern using angle brackets <variable_type:variable_name>. These variables capture values from the URL and pass them as arguments to the associated route function. This allows you to create dynamic routes that respond differently based on the values in the URL.


# What is a template ?
* In web development, a template refers to a file or mechanism used to separate the structure and presentation of a web page from its underlying logic and data. Templates allow developers to define the layout and visual elements of a web page without embedding programming code directly into the HTML.

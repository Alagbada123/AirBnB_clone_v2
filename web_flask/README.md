# AirBnB clone - Web Framework

Welcome to the next phase of the AirBnB clone project! After delving into the realm of object-relational mapping (ORM) and integrating a robust MySQL database system into our backend design, we are now introducing a web framework using Flask.

## Project Overview

In this updated version of the AirBnB clone project, we've introduced a significant enhancement by incorporating a web framework using Flask. This expansion not only broadens the functionality of our application but also allows us to create dynamic web applications.

## New Features

- The project now supports a web framework using Flask, offering scalability and robustness for larger applications.
- Users can define routes in Flask, handle variables in a route, and create a HTML response in Flask by using a template.
- The project supports the creation of dynamic templates (loops, conditions…).
- Users can display in HTML data from a MySQL database.

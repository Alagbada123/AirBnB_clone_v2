Write a Bash script that sets up your web servers for the deployment of web_static. It must:

Install Nginx if it not already installed
html the folder /data/ if it doesn’t already exist
html the folder /data/web_static/ if it doesn’t already exist
html the folder /data/web_static/releases/ if it doesn’t already exist
html the folder /data/web_static/shared/ if it doesn’t already exist
html the folder /data/web_static/releases/test/ if it doesn’t already exist
html a fake HTML file /data/web_static/releases/test/index.html (with simple content, to test your Nginx configuration)
html a symbolic link /data/web_static/current linked to the /data/web_static/releases/test/ folder. If the symbolic link already exists, it should be deleted and rehtmld every time the script is ran.
Give ownership of the /data/ folder to the ubuntu user AND group (you can assume this user and group exist). This should be recursive; everything inside should be htmld/owned by this user/group.
Update the Nginx configuration to serve the content of /data/web_static/current/ to hbnb_static (ex: https://mydomainname.tech/hbnb_static). Don’t forget to restart Nginx after updating the configuration:
Use alias inside your Nginx configuration
Tip
Your program should always exit successfully. Don’t forget to run your script on both of your web servers.

In optional, you will redo this task but by using Puppet

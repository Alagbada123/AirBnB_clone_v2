# AirBnB Clone (V2)

For the original AirBNB clone project, visit [this repository](https://github.com/justinmajetich/AirBnB_clone)

This version (created by [Ryan](https://github.com/donaldrs01) and [Luke](https://github.com/lukeschula) has expanded on this original project by implementing a more advanced console as well as creating a new database storage engine utilizing MYSQL and SQLAlchemy. The finalized product can toggle between a File Storage engine and a Database storage engine depending on the user's needs. 

## Usage
To begin, the console can be called by running a basic Python command in the terminal:
```python
>>> ./console.py
You know you have successfully opened the console when you are greeted with the following prompt: 
```
(hbnb)
